# AGENTS.md & Project Docs Integration

Codex CLI can incorporate persistent, global, and project-specific memory into its context via Markdown files. This ensures the model is always equipped with your project's goals, guidelines, and constraints.

## Where Codex Looks for Instructions:
- `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` — Personal/global developer guidance
- `AGENTS.md` at repo root — Shared project/team documentation
- `AGENTS.md` in current working directory — Subproject/feature configs

All relevant docs are merged top-down for maximum context:
1. Personal guidance
2. Project-level docs
3. Subfolder/scope-specific docs

## Use Cases
- Enforcing coding standards and file organization
- Defining project/feature-level guardrails
- Sharing best practices for a team or contract developers
- Pre-loading helpful context, TODOs, or future directions for Codex to consider

## Example
_Project Root AGENTS.md:_
```markdown
# Project Guidelines
- All React components must be in `src/components/`
- Document each API endpoint in OpenAPI format
- Use Prettier for linting before merging PRs
```

_User Home AGENTS.md:_
```markdown
# My Codex Preferences
- Prefer Python unless otherwise specified
- Always run tests after editing a file
```

## Disabling Project Doc Loading
- Use `--no-project-doc` to skip loading AGENTS.md/project docs
- Or set `CODEX_DISABLE_PROJECT_DOC=1` in the environment
