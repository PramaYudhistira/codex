# Codex CLI Examples & Usage Guide

## Overview
Codex CLI ships with a set of practical, self-contained examples that demonstrate how to run interactive coding agent sessions, apply prompting strategies, and integrate Codex into real-world workflows.

---

## Example Structure (Quickstart)
Each packaged example (see `codex-cli/examples/`) contains:

- `run.sh`: launches Codex CLI with a well-crafted prompt (reads from `task.yaml`)
- `task.yaml`: the main prompt or high-level description for Codex
- `template/`: starter files, existing code, or extra context for the agent to see
- `runs/`: created by the helper, stores the outputs/work for each agent session

**To run an example:**
```shell
cd codex-cli/examples/camerascii
./run.sh
# This launches Codex with a prompt to build animated webcam ASCII art
```
Open the produced file (e.g. `runs/run_1/index.html`) to view the result.

Other featured examples:
- **build-codex-demo**: recreate the original Codex demo
- **impossible-pong**: see if the agent can make harder pong levels
- **prompt-analyzer**: data science with real prompt clustering

## Prompting & Usage Patterns
See [`prompting_guide.md`](./examples/prompting_guide.md) for complete guidance on:
- Small tasks: single file/function edits
- Medium/long tasks: multi-file refactors via markdown prompt files
- Large projects: project scoping with .codex/ workspaces and requirements docs

### Example CLI Sessions
```shell
codex "Create a poem.html webpage themed on AI programming"
codex --full-auto "bulk-rename all *.jpeg -> *.jpg using git mv"
codex "Write unit tests for utils/date.ts"
```

**Use interactive mode for step-by-step control; full-auto for rapid iteration.**

## Custom Instructions
- User-global: `~/.codex/instructions.md` for your overarching guidance
- Project-specific: `CODEX.md` for repo-specific customs (auto-included)

## Using as Automation/CI
See the main README for [GitHub Actions](../../README.md#non-interactive--ci-mode) snippets to use Codex in CI, for changelog generation, doc updates, or bulk refactoring.
