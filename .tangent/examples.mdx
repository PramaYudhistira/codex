# Codex CLI Examples and Prompting Guide

## Overview

The Codex CLI ships with self-contained, practical examples and a comprehensive prompting guide to illustrate agentic workflows and effective prompt engineering.

## Example Projects (`codex-cli/examples/`)

Each example (e.g., `camerascii`, `impossible-pong`, `prompt-analyzer`) includes:
- `run.sh`: Script to set up a fresh session, copy starter templates, and launch a Codex session from a YAML-defined prompt.
- `task.yaml`: The YAML-formatted prompt or detailed instructions for Codex.
- `template/`: Optional starter project files Codex can build on or modify.
- `runs/`: Output folder with per-run artifacts and generated results.

**How to Run**
```sh
cd codex-cli/examples/camerascii
./run.sh
# Confirm CLI requests; open runs/run_1/index.html in your browser
```

Other included samples:
- **build-codex-demo**: Recreates the original Codex introduction demo
- **impossible-pong**: Lets Codex write new Pong levels
- **prompt-analyzer**: Data science app for prompt clustering

## Prompting Guide (`prompting_guide.md`)
Detailed guide on getting the most from Codex prompts and model workflows. Highlights:

- **Starter Tasks:** Get immediate hands-on results (`codex "write 2-3 sentences on what you can do"`)
- **Custom Instructions:** Project-wide (CODEX.md), and global user instructions (`~/.codex/instructions.md`) influence the agent for context or safety (e.g., always use a Python virtualenv for shell commands)
- **Prompting Techniques:**
  - *Small requests*: Tightly scoped, actionable, just like precise code review or bug description.
  - *Medium tasks*: Use files or detailed text, e.g., `codex "$(cat task_description.md)"`
  - *Large/Agentic flows*: Codex can plan and chain steps for repos or complex refactorsâ€”describe bigger goals, provide encouragement or path guidance.
  - *Chain-of-thought*: Ask Codex to reason step-wise, or request thought traces for troubleshooting and iterative improvement.

**Example prompts:**
```sh
codex "Modify the discount function utils/priceUtils.js to apply a 10 percent discount"
codex "Refactor all API handlers in src/api/ to use async/await and add error handling"
codex "Given README.md and src/index.js, write quick unit tests for all exported functions. Save results in tests/"
```
