# Repository Overview

## Introduction

This repository contains the **OpenAI Codex CLI**—a lightweight, terminal-based coding agent designed to supercharge developer productivity. It combines ChatGPT-level reasoning with the power to run code, manipulate files, and iterate, all under version control and in the safety of a sandboxed environment.

## Core Features

- **Chat-driven coding**: Use conversational prompts to refactor, generate tests, explain code, bulk-modify files, and more.
- **Terminal Native**: Designed for developers who live in the terminal, supporting a TUI and non-interactive (CI/pipeline) modes.
- **Multi-model & Multi-provider**: Out-of-the-box support for OpenAI models via API key or login, plus "bring your own model" support (Ollama, OpenRouter, Azure, etc.) via flexible TOML config.
- **Powerful sandboxing**: Secure execution through platform-specific sandboxing (macOS uses Apple Seatbelt, Linux via Landlock/seccomp).
- **Zero setup**: Works instantly with your OpenAI API key; configures advanced providers via simple TOML files.
- **Open source, community-driven**: Active development, high standards for code quality, and $1 million in open source funding to stimulate contributions.

## Repository Structure

- `codex-cli/` - JavaScript/TypeScript CLI front-end, examples, bin scripts.
- `codex-rs/` - Rust-powered backend/workspace; includes core logic, sandboxing, patch application, and more, organized into sub-crates.
- `src/` - Additional components, utilities, hooks, and tests for CLI, TUI, approval mechanisms.
- `scripts/` - Helper Bash/Python scripts for building, running, and utilities.
- `docs/` - Documentation and protocol specifications.
- `tests/` - Tests for core logic and components.

## Getting Started

### Install

```sh
npm install -g @openai/codex         # Or: brew install codex
```

### Configure

- **OpenAI API:** Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` env var.
- **Other providers:** Edit `~/.codex/config.toml` with your model providers and profiles.

### Usage

```sh
codex                                 # Launches interactive TUI
codex "Explain this codebase to me"   # One-shot prompt
codex --full-auto "create a todo app" # Automatic, minimal approvals/sandbox interruptions
```

#### Example Workflow

```sh
codex "Write unit tests for src/utils/date.ts"
```
1. Generates tests
2. Attempts to run them
3. Iterates/fixes until they pass (in safe sandbox)

## Security Model

- Runs untrusted code under a secure sandbox.
- Approval policies and sandbox policies are fully configurable.
- Network actions, file writes, and command execution are tightly controlled depending on mode and settings.

## Developer Guidance

- **Rust core**—build via Cargo, run with `cargo run --bin codex`.
- **Extensible**—add new model provider profiles, approval policies, CLI commands, etc.
- **Contribute:** PRs, bug reports, feature requests welcome! See the [Contributing](./README.md#contributing) section for workflow standards.
