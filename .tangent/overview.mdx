# Overview & Getting Started with Codex CLI

Codex CLI is a local coding agent that brings AI-powered, chat-driven software development to your terminal. It helps you write, refactor, and understand code directly from your workspace, offering helpful automations, secure sandbox execution, and customizable configuration.

## What is Codex CLI?
Codex CLI is a developer assistant designed to run locally and securely with:
- LLM-backed code generation, editing, and explanation
- Full terminal and version control integration
- Secure sandboxing and approval workflows
- Customizable models and providers, supporting OpenAI and 3rd-party LLMs

## Core Features
- **Interactive TUI & Automation:** Run `codex` for full interactive chat, or use `codex exec` to automate coding tasks in CI.
- **Configurable Providers:** Supports OpenAI, Azure, Ollama, Mistral, and custom models with chat or responses API compatibility.
- **Secure execution:** Sandbox and approval settings let you control what code can run and how changes are applied.
- **Multimodal:** Accepts code, text, and images as input for creative tasks.
- **Project Docs Integration:** Reads AGENTS.md files and repo context to inform agent actions.

## Installation
Install using Homebrew (recommended):
```sh
brew install codex
```
Or using NPM (installs native binaries for all platforms):
```sh
npm i -g @openai/codex
```
Or download a binary from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/openai/codex/releases/latest).

## Quickstart
1. **Set your OpenAI API key:**
   ```sh
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
   ```
   Or run `codex login` if using a paid OpenAI account.

2. **Start Codex Interactive Mode:**
   ```sh
   codex
   ```
   Or run a command inline:
   ```sh
   codex "explain this codebase to me"
   ```
   Enable full automation:
   ```sh
   codex --full-auto "create a todo app"
   ```

3. **Use Profiles for different models:** (edit `~/.codex/config.toml`)
   ```toml
   [profiles.mistral]
   model_provider = "ollama"
   model = "mistral"
   ```
   Then run:
   ```sh
   codex --profile mistral "generate a fast API stub"
   ```

## Example Usage Scenarios
- Refactor React components automatically: `codex "Refactor the Dashboard component to React Hooks"`
- Generate SQL migrations: `codex "Generate SQL migrations for adding a users table"`
- Write tests: `codex "Write unit tests for utils/date.ts"`
- CI automation: `codex exec --full-auto "update CHANGELOG for next release"`
