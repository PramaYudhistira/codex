# Testing & Development Workflow

Codex CLI is built with testability and developer iteration in mind. Automated tests, linting, type checks, and rich debug support are integrated for both the TypeScript and Rust projects.

## TypeScript CLI (codex-cli)
- **Run all tests:**
  ```sh
  pnpm test
  ```
- **Run tests in watch mode:**
  ```sh
  pnpm test:watch
  ```
- **Lint and format checks:**
  ```sh
  pnpm run lint
  pnpm format:fix
  ```
- **Type checking (non-emitting):**
  ```sh
  pnpm typecheck
  ```
- **Commit Quality (Husky):** Pre-commit and pre-push hooks via Husky ensure that only formatted, linted, and tested code makes it into commits.
- **Debugging:**
  - Build first: `pnpm run build`
  - Debug: `node --inspect-brk ./dist/cli.js`
  - Attach via Chrome's devtools or VSCode breakpointing

## Rust Workspace (codex-rs)
- **Build:**
  ```sh
  cargo build
  ```
- **Format:**
  ```sh
  cargo fmt
  ```
- **Static Analysis:**
  ```sh
  cargo clippy --tests
  ```
- **Run Tests:**
  ```sh
  cargo test
  ```
- **Try TUI:**
  ```sh
  cargo run --bin codex -- "summarize this codebase"
  ```
- **Shell Completion Scripts:**
  ```sh
  codex completion bash
  ```
- **Sandbox Testing:**
  ```sh
  codex debug seatbelt [COMMAND]  # macOS
  codex debug landlock [COMMAND]  # Linux
  ```
