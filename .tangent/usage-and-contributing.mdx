# Usage & Contributing Guide

## CLI Installation & Quickstart
- **Node/TS:**
  - `npm install -g @openai/codex` (or `brew install codex`)
- **Rust Native:**
  - `npm install -g @openai/codex@native` (or download from GitHub Release)

Run with:
```sh
codex "explain this repo"
codex --help
```
See [Overview](./overview.mdx) and [Examples](./codex-cli-examples.mdx) for full usage patterns.

---

## Repository Structure
- `codex-cli/`: Main CLI (TypeScript, React Ink TUI, JS/TS agent logic, utils, tests)
- `codex-rs/`: Rust native implementation (multi-crate workspace)
- Other files: `.npmrc`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `docs/`, etc.

This is a [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) monorepo: see [PNPM.md](../PNPM.md) for dev commands and workspace management.

## Contributing
We welcome all forms of contribution! Please see the core values and processes:

### Development Workflow
- Start a topic branch off `main` for each feature/fix
- Keep commits & PRs focused
- Run all lints/tests locally (`pnpm test`, etc)
- Open an issue for large design/discussion changes when possible
- Document user-facing behavior changes (in README, help, or examples)
- Strive for atomic commits that keep the tree green

### CLA & DCO
- All contributors must accept the CLA (handled by CLA-Assistant bot upon PR)
- Re-sign CLA with a PR comment if prompted
- Ensure PRs/commits carry DCO footers for mergeability

### Community Values
- **Be kind and inclusive** (see [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/))
- **Assume good intent**; written communication can be misread
- **Teach and learn**; suggest improvements, open issues/PRs for documentation

### Getting Help
- Use Issues or Discussions for setup problems, questions, or new ideas
- Email security@openai.com for security reports
